This project focuses on implementing various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues, along with relevant methods and operations.
The project consists of the following components:

 1) Linked Lists:
 Implementation of a singly linked list.
 Methods include printing and insertion
 Special operations like deleting prime nodes and merge sorting lists.

 2) Stacks and Queues:
 Implementations of stacks and queues using linked lists.
 Operations include push/pop for stacks and add/delete for queues.

 3) Expression Notation Conversion and Evaluation:
 Conversion between different expression notations (e.g., infix to postfix).
 Evaluation of expressions using stacks.
